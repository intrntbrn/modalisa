# ⌨️ modalisa 🎨

`modalisa` is a hybrid modal keymap framework for awesomewm.
It comes with a preconfigured keymap that includes all default awesomewm
controls (and a lot more), but can also be used for all kinds of applications.
It is designed to combine best of both traditional and modal input modes while
also looking pretty.

Traditional input modes (e.g. default awesomewm) suffer from complicated keymaps that usually require to press several modifiers simultaneously due to limited keyspace.
There are also no key suggestions or reminders and the user has to rely on his
memory or unpractical cheatsheets.
On the other hand, modal input modes allow for comfortable to enter key sequences, but can be
cumbersome to use when repeating actions, forcing the user to repeat the whole
sequence or to specify a count beforehand.

`modalisa` addresses these shortcomings by keeping track of modifier states to
provide a set of distinct input modes that can be tailored exactly to the user's
needs for each key and at every stage of the sequence individually.
For instance it is possible to have traditional keybinds for common operations
that be can repeated by holding down the modifier, while also to tap the modifier (like a leader key) to enter modal mode followed by a key sequence for not so common commands.
This flexible approach makes it possible to slowly transition into a more
modal-esque keymap, while not having to relearn most of awesomewm controls.
